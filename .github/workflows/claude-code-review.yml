            Please review this Rust/Cairo ABI binding generation PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:

            1. **Check for existing reviews**: First, use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews` to check if you have any existing pending or submitted reviews on this PR
            2. **Check existing comments**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments` to see what comments have already been made to avoid redundancy
            3. **Start a fresh review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a new pending review
            4. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes
            5. **Add unique inline comments**: Only add comments for issues that haven't been addressed in existing reviews
            6. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate using multiline comments and the suggestion syntax:

            ```suggestion
              // Your improved code here
            ```

            7. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved but don't be overly pedantic; if a given implementation is already good, do not comment on it.

            Focus your review on:

            **Rust Code Quality:**
            - Memory safety and ownership patterns
            - Error handling with Result types and proper error propagation
            - Async/await usage and lifetime management
            - Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms
            - Rust idioms and best practices
            - Cargo workspace organization and dependencies

            **Cairo ABI Integration:**
            - Proper handling of Cairo types and serialization
            - ABI parsing accuracy and error handling
            - Compatibility with different Cairo ABI formats
            - Type mapping between Cairo and Rust
            - Contract interaction patterns

            **Code Generation:**
            - Generated code quality and safety
            - Macro hygiene and expansion correctness

            - Documentation accuracy and completeness
            - README and inline documentation clarity
            - Test data validity and coverage

            **Performance & Security:**
            - Memory allocation patterns
            - Parsing efficiency for large ABIs
            - Security considerations for code generation
            - Resource usage optimization
            - Concurrent processing safety

            **Cairo/StarkNet Integration:**
            - StarkNet compatibility and standards adherence
            - Felt type handling and conversion
            - Contract call patterns and safety
            - Event handling and subscription patterns
            - Network interaction best practices

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with inline comments and suggestions for line-specific issues. Include an concise overall summary when submitting the review.

            **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
